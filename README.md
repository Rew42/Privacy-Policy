Privacy Policy

  Last Updated: July 10, 2019

  Welcome! This Privacy Policy explains how VluCorp ("VluCorp" or "we") collects, uses, and shares your personal information while you 
play VluCorp's games ("Games") We may make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this 
Privacy Policy, we will notify you via email if we have your email address on record and/or Games prior to the change becoming effective.

  1. What kind of personal information does VluCorp collect?

  We aim to minimize how much personal information we collect from users when they play the Games. Most of our data collection is 
  limited to the following types of data, which do not identify you personally but may uniquely identify the device you are using to 
  play to the Games ("Device"). In some countries, this type of data may be considered as personal information:
· "Advertising ID", which means the resettable and unique identifier associated with your mobile phone or tablet that is used by 
advertisers for ad tracking.
· "Location Information", which means general information about the location from which you're playing the Games (e.g. IP address,
country, and city).
· "Device Information", which means technical information about your Device. When we refer to Device Information, this means your
Device ID, your internet service provider (ISP), your browser and browser plug-in types, operating system and operating system 
version, jailbreak information, network information, the brand and manufacturer of your Device, the language you've set for your 
Device, the version of the Game installed on your Device, and the name of your carrier.

  Does VluCorp Collect My Financial Information When I Make In-App Purchases?
  
  When you make in-app purchases in the Games, we do not collect or have any access to your name and billing information.
This information is collected and stored by your platform (e.g. Apple's Game Store or Android's Google Play) or 
your platform's payment processor.

  2. How long will VluCorp keep my personal information?
  
  How long we store your personal information will depend on the purpose that we originally collected it. We will not retain
personal information for longer than is necessary for our business or for legal requirements.

  3. How is my personal information used for analytics?

  As an online business, it is important for us to know how users interact with our Games. We and our Service Providers
will collect your Location Information, Device Information, and Advertising IDs so that we can deliver our Game services to our users, 
measure, analyze, and improve performance of the Games, and to continually update and develop our Games. For example, we will use
this information to assess the difficulty level of Games, fix any bugs or errors in the Games, evaluate the demographic of our users, 
and to determine whether or not we need to support a new Device type for the Games.

  4. How is my personal information used for advertising?

  A. Ad Partner Technologies
  To help us keep our Games running, we show ads in our Games with the help of third-party advertising partners ("Ad Partners").
We integrate Ad Partners' technologies into our Games which are then used by the Ad Partners to determine what kind of ads 
to display to you.
  i. Do Ad Partners Collect My Personal Information?
  In order to show you ads that you might interesting and/or relevant ("Targeted Ads"), Ad Partners collect and use your Advertising ID,
Location Information, and Device Information. If location services are enabled in your Device settings, the Ad Partners may additionally
collect your geolocation information. Now, we have only one Ad Partner “Unity Ads”. Check their Privacy Policy here: 
https://unity3d.com/ru/legal/privacy-policy

  B. Ads for the Games on Third-Party Websites and/or Apps
  In addition to running ads in our Games, we also run ads to promote our Games in third-party websites and/or apps. When we run our 
own ads in third-party websites and/or apps, Service Providers help us optimize and measure performance of our ads and use their own 
tracking technologies to track Game installs and clicks and/or impressions of our ads. In some cases, we will share your hashed 
or anonymized Advertising ID with our Ad Partners so that the Ad Partner can help us market and promote our Games. In these cases, 
Ad Partners perform as VluCorp's Service Providers and we contractually require such Ad Partners to only use your personal information
on our behalf. If you wish to opt-out of your personal information being shared with Ad Partners in this way, please contact us
at vlucorp.games@gmail.com.

  5. Third-parties and their privacy policies.

  Throughout the Websites, you may see links to third-party websites or applications. We are not responsible for the privacy practices
of these third-party sites, and when accessing their sites, we encourage you to read their privacy policies.

  6. Is my personal information secure?

  The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect your 
information, both during transmission and once it is received. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of 
electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. While no security system is completely secure,
we and our Service Provider stake appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access or disclosure of the information 
collected by us. For VluCorp, this includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that all of your information is disclosed only on 
a "need to know" basis and ensuring that all information collected by VluCorp is done so via secured connections and protected and 
encrypted (using secure socket layer technology, "SSL") by industrial grade security software to guard against unauthorized access.

  7. Sharing your personal information for business/legal reasons.

  A. Business Transfers. As we continue to develop our business, we may reorganize as a business entity, acquire entities, subsidiaries,
or business units, or enter into joint ventures with third-parties. In any of these types of transactions, any information you provide
may be one of the transferred business assets (subject to any pre-existing privacy notice unless you consent otherwise). In the event
that all or substantially all of our assets are acquired or we merge with a third-party, your information will likely be one of the
transferred assets. You understand and agree that we reserve the right to transfer any information collected from you in the case of 
any such transfer. In such event, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes
subject to a different privacy policy.

  B. Legal. We may disclose information you provide to respond to subpoenas, court orders, requests from authorities, and other legal
process, and to establish/exercise our legal rights. We may also disclose your information to defend against legal claims when 
we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, 
or respond to a government request. We may share your information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal
activities, suspected fraud, and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, 
violations of our Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.

  10. How do i access, manage, or update my personal information?

please contact us at vlucorp.games@gmail.com

  11. For users in the european union.

  A. Legal Basis for Processing. Our legal basis for collecting, using, and sharing your personal information will depend on the purpose
for which we use your personal information. Typically, we will rely on the following legal bases for processing your personal
information: (i) your consent; (ii) where our processing is in our legitimate interest (e.g. processing for analytics or direct
marketing) or in the legitimate interest of our Ad Partners or Service Providers; or (iii) where our processing is necessary to perform
a contract with you (e.g. to make the Games or Websites accessible to you). If we rely on your consent to process your personal 
information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.

  B. Your Personal Information Rights. If you would like to exercise your rights of access, rectification, erasure, restriction
of processing, data portability, and/or your right to object to the processing of your personal information, please contact us
(Section 12).

  C. Transfer of Personal Information Outside of the EU. Because our Service Providers are located in countries outside of the 
European Union, your personal information will be transferred to other countries that may not offer the same level of data protection 
as the laws of your country of residence. We rely on model contractual clauses and/or the Privacy Shield certification for such
transfers.

  D. How to File Complaints. If you believe your rights under the GDPR have been violated, you may lodge a complaint with the
supervisory authority of your country of residence. For contact information for your supervisory authority, please visit here.
